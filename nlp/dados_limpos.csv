negative,American,"@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that"
negative,United,@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
negative,Delta,@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
negative,United,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options?"
negative,United,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
negative,American,"@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to ""heavy call volume."""
negative,United,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always

negative,US Airways,@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
negative,American,@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold"

negative,US Airways,@USAirways always letting me down. üëä
negative,United,@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
negative,United,"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
negative,United,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
negative,American,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
negative,American,@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
negative,United,"@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
negative,United,@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
negative,United,@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
negative,American,@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
negative,US Airways,@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.

negative,American,@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
negative,United,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
negative,United,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
negative,Delta,@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
negative,US Airways,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
negative,American,@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Your hold music needs 2 be fixed:certain tracks have loud phone button mashing tones in them.Estimated wait time would help 2.

negative,US Airways,@USAirways Past tense re help. No more. It‚Äôs been even more miserable than usual at CLT.
negative,United,"@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated."
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir yes. Hung up and called a different number.
negative,United,"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."

negative,United,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.

negative,American,"@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox."
negative,Delta,@JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
negative,United,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...

negative,American,@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.

negative,American,@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
negative,United,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
negative,US Airways,@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
negative,American,@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
negative,United,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
negative,United,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.

negative,Delta,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
negative,American,@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
negative,United,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...

negative,US Airways,@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?

negative,American,@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
negative,US Airways,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
negative,American,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!"
negative,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir why are you literally the worst?
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir There is no way that I am getting back on a plane with your airline. I will be calling to get a refund. As I drive 17 hrs home
negative,United,@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
negative,United,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
negative,Delta,@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.

negative,US Airways,"@USAirways 30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic"
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
negative,US Airways,@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
negative,US Airways,@USAirways just Cancelled Flighted my flight and told me to call to rebook. Been on hold for 48 minutes at 4 am and still waiting
negative,US Airways,@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
negative,United,@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
negative,US Airways,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
negative,American,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
negative,United,@united you're terrible.
negative,American,@AmericanAir I understand you are busy but I have still gotten no answer. I need to get home and you guys have not helped at all
negative,American,"@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times."
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
negative,American,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
negative,United,"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
negative,American,@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!

negative,American,"@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please"
negative,American,@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
negative,United,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
negative,American,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative,US Airways,.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
negative,American,@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
negative,United,@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
negative,United,@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
negative,American,@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
negative,United,@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
negative,United,@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
negative,American,@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
negative,American,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
negative,United,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
negative,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!

negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight."

negative,United,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled out of BNA.... Do I have to reschedule now or can travel funds be put back into my account for future use?
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I was helped by a nice lady at PHX checkin. I spent 4 hours on hold in 24 hours, so might want to look at efficiency there."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?

That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth!"
negative,United,@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
negative,United,"@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?"
negative,American,@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
negative,American,@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
negative,US Airways,@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
negative,American,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
negative,United,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!

negative,US Airways,@USAirways flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot!
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent"
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways rant cont... To top it all off, rescheduled flight to TPA at 10:10 is already delayed. How can they be that bad?"
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP"
negative,United,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.

negative,American,@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
negative,Delta,@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
negative,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
negative,United,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
negative,United,@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
negative,United,@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
negative,Delta,@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no

negative,American,@AmericanAir can't get thru to anyone on phone
negative,American,"@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful."

negative,United,"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."
negative,American,@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
negative,US Airways,@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
negative,American,"@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?"

negative,US Airways,@USAirways Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!?
negative,United,@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver

negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice"
negative,Delta,@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
negative,United,@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
negative,United,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
negative,United,@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
negative,US Airways,@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
negative,American,@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
negative,American,@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
negative,Delta,@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
negative,United,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh]
negative,United,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
negative,US Airways,@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them

negative,United,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
negative,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???"
negative,Delta,@JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note
negative,United,"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
negative,Delta,@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
negative,United,@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter

negative,Delta,"@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/"
negative,Delta,@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold trying to reschedule Cancelled Flightled flight. Hold music stopped, but no one's answering. How can I reach a rep?"
negative,United,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.

negative,Delta,@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
negative,United,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen?
negative,Delta,@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate.

negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min...."
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part..."
negative,United,@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
negative,United,@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed."

negative,United,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
negative,United,"@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog"
negative,American,@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston"
negative,United,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."

negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?

negative,Delta,@JetBlue can't change it. True blue points and I can't get to a phone
negative,American,"@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again."

negative,United,@united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi.
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue, I've experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.

negative,US Airways,@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
negative,United,@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
negative,Delta,@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
negative,Delta,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
negative,United,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!

negative,United,"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
negative,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
negative,American,@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
negative,United,@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.

negative,Delta,"@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat"
negative,Delta,@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?

negative,United,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
negative,United,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
negative,American,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.

negative,Delta,@JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
negative,American,@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?

negative,United,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
negative,American,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
negative,American,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?

negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
negative,United,@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
negative,American,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic"

negative,US Airways,@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
negative,American,@AmericanAir can you?
negative,Delta,@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
negative,United,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"

negative,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a ""tech stop""?"
negative,United,@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?

negative,United,@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
negative,American,"@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?"
negative,United,@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
negative,Delta,@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me

negative,US Airways,@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
negative,American,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
negative,US Airways,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
negative,United,@united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
negative,American,@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
negative,American,@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best

negative,United,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
negative,United,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
negative,United,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."

negative,US Airways,@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
negative,United,@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
negative,United,@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Worst customer service ever. You Cancelled Flightled my connecting flight to NY hours ago &amp; didn't tell me. Now I'm stuck in Tampa.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm."
negative,Delta,@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
negative,Delta,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
negative,US Airways,@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)"
negative,Delta,@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!

negative,US Airways,@USAirways what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs
negative,US Airways,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
negative,American,"@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!"
negative,United,"@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!"
negative,American,"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways I believe you. But in all seriousness, what's an acceptable time I should have this expense on my name that wasn't my fault...."
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
negative,Delta,@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
negative,US Airways,".@USAirways worst experience of all time. Will never, ever, ever travel with you again. EVER"
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you."

negative,United,"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
negative,American,@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
negative,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica hi! i'm so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i've been trying 2 book since last week &amp; the page never loads. thx!
negative,United,@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
negative,American,@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways Ill never fly you again due to the emotional &amp; financial stress you have caused me because of one of your staff members errors.
negative,American,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I recommend upgrading your IVR and using call back, email, and texting from a know caller."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
negative,US Airways,@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
negative,American,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
negative,American,@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
negative,American,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir I'm flying in a couple of weeks and I need my ticket changed from my maiden name to my married name. Pls help!
negative,United,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
negative,American,@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight
negative,US Airways,@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?
negative,American,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
negative,United,"Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals"
negative,United,"@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou"
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir On hold with airline 45 min and counting. Service is terrible!
negative,Delta,@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
negative,United,‚Äú@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH‚Äù always blame the customer
negative,United,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
negative,American,@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
negative,United,@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
negative,Delta,@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir flight to PHL from FLL Cancelled Flighted 2/21 no flight available until 2/24 done with SW. They are a pain to deal with
negative,US Airways,@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
negative,US Airways,@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
negative,United,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
negative,United,@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
negative,United,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
negative,United,@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
negative,Delta,@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It‚Äôs a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it!
negative,United,@united still no response??
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web?"
negative,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir VERY frustrated. Saw seats avail. online for pref alt. flight, unable to book online, lost those seats during &gt;2 hr phone hold"
negative,United,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
negative,United,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
negative,US Airways,@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
negative,United,"@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded."
negative,United,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
negative,Delta,STOP. USING.THIS.WORD. IF. YOU'RE. A. COMPANY. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Fd2TNYcTrB
negative,Delta,"@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you..."
negative,United,@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
negative,US Airways,@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
negative,American,@AmericanAir tried that and can't get through.
negative,United,"@united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive"
negative,United,@united direct messages not going through please help
negative,American,"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
negative,United,@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
negative,United,.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
negative,US Airways,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
negative,Delta,STOP THIS ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn‚Äù
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
negative,American,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
negative,United,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
negative,US Airways,@USAirways how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer???
negative,US Airways,@USAirways my option is to use twitter. Most of the people working for u have no clue what they do. they tell you to go to A4 but its b16
negative,United,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
negative,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir ok the app doesn't seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1
negative,United,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
negative,US Airways,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
negative,United,@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
negative,American,"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
negative,Delta,@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
negative,American,@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
negative,Delta,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
negative,US Airways,@USAirways this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me.
negative,US Airways,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
negative,American,"@AmericanAir as of now, will do my best to never fly w/ #AmericanAirlines ever again. Y'all have made this a day to remember."
negative,Delta,@JetBlue Oh no! I thought it did. :(
negative,United,"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
negative,United,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
negative,United,"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
negative,American,"@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll"
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir 40 minutes still haven't talked to one person #shocking phone is gonna died before I talk to anyone http://t.co/iWoiGRLHXb
negative,US Airways,@USAirways on hold 2.5 hrs trying to reschedule our flight. Can anyone there please help us?
negative,Delta,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
negative,Delta,"@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?"
negative,US Airways,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
negative,Delta,@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour
negative,United,@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
negative,American,"@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"
negative,United,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
negative,United,"@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?"
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir you cx'ed almost the entire east coast flights All other planes are taking off any traveling fine I need to get to Nev ASAP
negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
